# Splurge Stop!

The second leg of my path to learn to code. 
This voyage takes me to the realms of DDD, ASP.NET Core and React (Redux),
and probably some yet unknown adventures including desperation 
but hopefully some insight as well.

**Frameworks & libraries:**

.NET Standard 2.1
- SplurgeStop.Data.EF
  - Data access project (Entity Framework Core 3.1)
- SplurgeStop.Domain
  - Domain project

.NET Core 3.1
- SplurgeStop.UI.WebApi
  - ASP.NET Core API (C# 8.0, Serilog)
- SplurgeStop.*.Tests, 
  - Test projects (xUnit, Moq)

User interfaces
- splurgestop.ui.react
  - React (Router, Redux, TypeScript)
- splurgestop.ui.reactsimple
  - React (JavaScript)

## Status

It's a start... not much else at the moment, especially on UI side.

### Back to basics
I think I hogged a little too big of a slice at once.
That for I added second React UI (.ui.reactsimple). 
(This one uses js instead of ts.) 
I'll try to keep this one really simple so I won't confuse myself again.
